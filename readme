BoomBlock is a puzzle game.

Rules:
The goal of the game is to get as many points as possible.

The game ends when the next block cannot be placed at the top of the playing area.

Some blocks have bomb (black circle) in them, and when a block with a bomb has three or more blocks of the same color in
its surrounding 3x3 area, it explodes all blocks in its 3x3 region explodes. If there is a bomb of any color in the areas
affected by the explosion, it will explode as well.
After the explosion, if there are blocks that are floating, they will drop, and if that causes a bomb to have three or
more blocks of the same color around it, that bomb will explode, and the player will get extra points.

The level goes up every ten explosions, and the player will gain more points, but the block will drop faster.
